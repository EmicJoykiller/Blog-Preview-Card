The Blog Preview Card project exemplifies my commitment to accessible and responsive web design, blending aesthetic appeal with user-centric functionality. This project features a visually engaging card design that effectively previews blog content, making it both attractive and easy to navigate. The layout is meticulously crafted using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques, ensuring that the design is fully responsive and accessible across all devices. Special attention was given to accessibility practices, including appropriate color contrasts, alt text for images, and keyboard navigation support, making the content accessible to users with disabilities. This project not only highlights my expertise in front-end design and development but also underscores my dedication to creating inclusive web experiences.
